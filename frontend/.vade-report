## Vercel Web Analytics Integration

Successfully integrated Vercel Web Analytics into the FusionAI frontend application.

### Overview
This change adds real-time web analytics to the FusionAI React application, allowing you to track visitors, page views, and user interactions through the Vercel Analytics dashboard.

### What Was Implemented

#### Added Dependency
- **@vercel/analytics** (v1.4.0) - Official Vercel analytics package for React applications

#### Files Modified
1. **frontend/package.json**
   - Added `@vercel/analytics` to dependencies
   - Allows the project to use Vercel's analytics SDK

2. **frontend/src/App.jsx**
   - Imported the `Analytics` component from `@vercel/analytics/react`
   - Added the `<Analytics />` component to the main App component's return statement
   - Placed after the main content to ensure proper DOM mounting

### Implementation Details

The Analytics component was integrated following Vercel's recommended pattern for React applications:
- The component is imported at the top of the file
- It's rendered as a child element within the main app wrapper
- No additional configuration is required for basic tracking

### How It Works

Once deployed to Vercel:
1. The Analytics component automatically injects the tracking script (`/_vercel/insights/script.js`)
2. Page views and visitor interactions are tracked without any additional code
3. Route changes are automatically detected (built-in for React Router compatibility)
4. Data appears in the Vercel Analytics dashboard within a few minutes

### Next Steps to Enable Tracking

1. Deploy the app to Vercel (if not already deployed)
2. Go to your Vercel project dashboard
3. Click the **Analytics** tab
4. Enable Web Analytics if not already enabled
5. Visit your deployed app to start tracking data
6. View analytics data in the dashboard after a few minutes

### Note on Route Support

The `@vercel/analytics/react` implementation automatically handles route tracking for applications using React Router or similar routing solutions. For plain React applications without routing libraries, route detection works based on page visibility changes and URL history updates.

### Testing

- ✅ Build successful: `npm run build` completes without errors
- ✅ No TypeScript/linting errors introduced
- ✅ Package installed correctly with npm
- ✅ Import statement verified
- ✅ Analytics component properly integrated into the component tree

### Verification Steps Performed

1. Explored project structure - identified React + Vite setup
2. Added `@vercel/analytics` dependency to package.json
3. Imported Analytics component in App.jsx
4. Integrated component into the main App render
5. Ran `npm install` - successful installation of 87 packages
6. Ran `npm run build` - build completed successfully with no errors
7. Verified file changes match the pattern in Vercel documentation

The implementation is minimal, non-invasive, and follows Vercel's best practices for React applications.
